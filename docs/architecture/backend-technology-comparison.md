   - Is the time cost of learning new technology acceptable?

2. **What are the project timeline requirements?**
   - How quickly does the MVP need to go live?
   - Is there enough time to learn new technology?

3. **What are the performance requirements?**
   - Expected number of concurrent users?
   - Response time requirements?

4. **What are the maintenance expectations?**
   - How long is the project expected to be maintained?
   - Will the team size expand?

5. **What are the special requirements?**

## Conclusion

Based on the requirements analysis of the MKing Friend dating platform, we strongly recommend adopting **Node.js + NestJS + TypeScript** as the main technology stack, which provides a good balance in development efficiency, maintainability, performance, and ecosystem.

If the team is more familiar with Python, or if there are future AI feature requirements, **Python + FastAPI** is also an excellent choice.

For scenarios with extremely high performance requirements, **Go + Gin** can be considered as the implementation language for specific services.

The final technology choice should be based on the team's actual situation, project requirements, and long-term planning. It is recommended to conduct small-scale technical validation first, confirm that the chosen technology stack can meet project requirements, and then proceed with large-scale development.
