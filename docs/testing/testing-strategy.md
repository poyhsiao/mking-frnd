# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the MKing Friend social platform. Our testing approach ensures high-quality software delivery through systematic validation of functionality, performance, security, and user experience.

## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Quality First**: Testing is integrated into every stage of development
2. **Shift Left**: Early testing reduces costs and improves quality
3. **Automation Focus**: Automated tests provide fast feedback and regression protection
4. **Risk-Based Testing**: Prioritize testing based on business impact and risk
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular retrospectives and strategy refinement

### Quality Goals
- **Functionality**: All features work as specified
- **Reliability**: System performs consistently under normal and stress conditions
- **Performance**: Response times meet user expectations
- **Security**: User data and system integrity are protected
- **Usability**: Intuitive and accessible user experience
- **Maintainability**: Code is testable and modifications are safe
