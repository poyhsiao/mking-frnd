## Conclusion

Based on the MKing Friend project requirements and self-hosting strategy, we recommend a phased deployment approach:

1. **Immediate Implementation**: Use MailHog for development testing
2. **MVP Phase**: Adopt MailerSend free plan for small-scale production
3. **Growth Phase**: Deploy self-hosted Mailcow for complete autonomous control

This strategy meets current development needs while providing flexibility for future expansion, aligning with the project's free self-hosting philosophy.
